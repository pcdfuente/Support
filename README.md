Support Wikis and FAQs

This repository is created to compile/document any Support material that we can use for trainings, and futre reviews.
This repository is not for escalation, specific Support ticket escalation, and not for opening new Support tickets; until further advise.

The goal of the author and the contributors is to make a wide available information for NEW and EXISTING support members.
FAQs to enhance ticket handling, and to have an overview about general issues we face everyday.

### Cheers to all SUPPORT members.
